Zig Game Boy emulator

## Why Zig?

Zig is a promising new language aimed at replacing C. Many Game Boy emulators
are written in C, C++, and Rust. While these languages definitely succeed in
emulating a Game Boy, I wanted to test out the power of Zig on a major project.

## Resources

There are many resources dedicated to Game Boy emulator development. A great
list can be found [here](https://github.com/avivace/awesome-gbdev).

## Roadmap

[ ] CPU implementation (needs tests)
[ ] Disassembler (needs tests)
[ ] Assembler (optional)
[ ] Compiler (optional)
[ ] Video emulation
